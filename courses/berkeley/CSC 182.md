[[Google's Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System: Enabling Zero-Shot Translation]]
- Improved efficiency: translating into and out of rare languages works better if the model is also trained on more common languages
- Zero-shot machine translation: Translating between pairs of languages that have been never been trained on as a pair

Key idea: machine learning becomes much easier if you have the correct representation!
