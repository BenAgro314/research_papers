Q: Name seven grand challenges for learned autonomous driving
A: Grand challenges:
1. Vehicle adaptability 
2. Modelling real-world complexity
3. Learning from accessible off-policy data
4. Safety under uncertainty (know when and what we don't know)
5. Interpretability of failures
6. generalization to new situations
7. Driving reward (ever changing optimization criteria)
